Analysis of worldwide fisheries catches with relation to satellite-derived environmental variables, aggregated at two spatial scales

Our work highlights the possible changes in fishery catch rate over time related with three environmental variables: Sea Surface Temperature (SST), concentrations of Chlorophyll (CHL), and the PIC:POC (PIC: Particulate Inorganic Carbon concentration; POC: Particulate Organic Carbon concentration) ratio at two spatial scales: worldwide and the nineteen FAO Major Fishing Area (FAO-MFA). We used FAO fishery database (FishStatJ) and MODIS Aqua satellite images from 2002 to 2015.
